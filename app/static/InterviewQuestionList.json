        "question": "Describe a task that you did by yourself",
        "answer": "<p>Key: Pick a medium size task and explain it clearly.</p><p>Example 1: While in project XXX, i was given task to write stored procedures for the data transfer in different inventory databases. I was the only person responsible for writing all the database programming. I wrote many triggers, stored procedures, functions, views and database links. I feel it was a great experience to me because I gained all the SQL experiences.</p><p>Example 2: I remember a task at XXXX, we were previously returning all the data in string format and fields are separated with semi colons. However, in some cases, the result string may contain semi colon as part of the contents which we should not parse it as delimiter.  Initially, we solve it case by case, but later on, we see it happens more when customer increases. So I proposed and created this task by myself to refine all the logic to use json format instead of the string format. I have to revise all the related logics and have to update about 100 java classes which return this result string. It is a big task but it is also one of the most impacted task to the project.</p><p>Example 3: When I was working on migrating the legacy system to new angular spring boot based system, I was given a task to rewrite the payment flow. Instead of just rewrite, I actually redesigned it and created a template for this workflow migration, i created several base classes and typescript files. With this case, all the future workflow migration just need to extend my template and the base classes. It becomes a new format and rule to the entire project. I become the expert in that project and I created a lot of documentations for that as well.</p>",

Inside that bucket, it is a tree structure of all key-value pairs that share the same hashcode. so to find the target key-value pair, the equals() method will be called, and once found, the value will be returned.</p><p>Hash collision: all the key-value pair that shares the same hashcode stays in same bucket, that is called hash collision. It is preferred in hashmap, because if there is NO hash collsion, each key-value pair will stay in one bucket, then there will be too many buckets, causing too much memory.  If all entries in one bucket, then it is hard to search the target. The hash collision makes the time complexity of hashmap to O(1) because of hashing.</p><p>Why hashmap use Tree structure in bucket:   Previously it is a list, but then changed to tree, because tree has left node smaller than root and root smaller than right. So the search is O(logn), much faster than list.</p><p><br></p>",

If we have Employee object and it contains another address object and updateEmployee() method. If we put synchronized on the method, it will lock the whole employee object. If we use synchronized(address) in the code, it will only lock the address field, will not lock whole employee object, So the synchronized block has better performance.</p><p><strong>ThreadLocal</strong>: If a variable is defined as ThreadLocal, then when a thread gets this variable, it will gets its own copy, so when this thread update this variable, it only updates its own copy, the other copies used by other threads will not be affected.</p><p><strong>Volatile</strong>: If a variable is volatile, it is kept at a core main memory. All threads will only read and update this main copy. They will not have their own copy. All threas share exactly the same main copy. It guarantees that if one thread updates the value, the other threads will get that updated value because there is only 1 copy.</p><p><strong>AtomicInteger</strong>: AtomicInteger/AtomicBoolean/AtomicReference etc: the 'atomic' is to make sure the operations on the variable is a single operation and cannot be splitted further.

        "answer": "<p>Principles:</p><p>For Authentication</p><ul><li><strong>Basic Authentication</strong>: use username and password authentication. the password should be encrypted. common encryption algorithm: BCrypt, SHA256, RSA.</li><li><strong>JWT Token</strong>: When the first time user login with username and password, backend will create a JWT token which contains the user info, the token will be stored in the frontend cookie. Every single request will carry this token, backend will validate this token to decide if user is authenticated. A token usually has a expiration time. </li><li><strong>Asymmetric key pairs</strong>: this is used for something like AWS command portal validation. It create a private key on server side and give public key to the client side. client with public key should be able to match with the private key on the server side.</li><li><strong>OAuth2</strong>: this is like 3rd party SSO (single sign on). Like for some applications, you can login with google or facebook. The application is pre-registered with the 3rd party, when a user login, it sends a request to 3rd party authentication server and gets a token, and once got the token, it will use that token to call the 3rd party authorization server to get the user role.

You just run your whole application with server together as a JAR file</li><li>Auto Configuration: Spring boot has auto configuration, as long as you put the properties there, spring boot will auto setup everything. Example, if you have Data Source entries in the application.properties file, Spring boot will try to auto connect the database for you.</li><li>Dependency Management: Spring boot wraps up related dependencies into \"starters\", like the Web Starter contains json, rest api, mvc model, server etc. You don't need to add them to POM.XML separately, also you dont need to worry about the version conflicts in the dependencies.</li><li>Actuator: Spring boot provides actuator which has many endpoints to tell the status of the spring boot application. Like:<em> /info</em> is to tell the status, <em>/health&nbsp;</em>summarizes the health status of our application. <em>/metrics&nbsp;</em>details metrics of our application. This might include generic metrics as well as custom ones.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Disadvantage:</p><p>Spring boot wrap too many things in the box, so many things are in under the cover.</p>",

The JWT token is stored in cookie and will be passed along every request. Each token can have an expiration time and can be extended. The token does not have to be saved to database.</li><li>Oauth2: we can also use Oauth2 to do authorization, it is 3rd part authorization, just like \"login with google\", :login with facebook\" etc. You first request 3rd party to get authentication token and then use that authentication token to get authorization access.</li><li>Asymmetric Key pair, also called public key and private key.

Like it can issue 1000 requests in 5 minutes and track how many pass, fail and timeout</p><p><strong>AB test</strong>: when you have two designs you cannot decide, so in production, 50% user see A and 50% user see B, and you check which one is more used by users so you know which one should be chosen.</p><p><br></p>",
